Authentication System Using Facial Recognition and QR Code

In today’s era, everyone is highly dependent on technology. All the tasks can almost be done digitally with the help of various technologies. Along with that, we also know the importance of security in today’s world. Proper authentication is important to stay safe and avoid any unnecessary problem. Facial recognition method captures the person’s image, extracts features from it (like face distance metrics, eye measurement etc.) and then recognizes who the person is based on the dataset available. Therefore, I have proposed a system for authentication based on facial biometrics and QR code. It makes sure that right people enter the system and access the right information..
